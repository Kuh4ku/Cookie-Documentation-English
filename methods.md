# Clone the GitHub

First you should make a copy of the project.

Download it here:

[Cookie GitHub](https://github.com/yovanoc/Cookie)

Or you can clone it with GitHub:

```batch
git clone https://github.com/yovanoc/Cookie.git
```

# Compilation

Once the project installed in the dame folder as the **Cookie.exe** you will need to create a foler named **config** and the two following files:

* **config/dofuspath.txt**
* **config/account.txt**

With the follwing content:

* Path to the dofus directory
* Username and Password

**dofuspath.txt**

```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Ankama\Dofus
```
